updated and complete task division including FIR entity, keeping dependencies and workflow in mind.

🚀 UPDATED ENTITY CREATION TASK PLAN (WITH FIR)

We now have 8 entities:

Station

User

Shift

LeaveRequest

SwapRequest

History

Complaint (Optional or separate)

FIR (Full FIR entity with realistic fields)

To avoid confusion:

Complaint = informal complaint → logged and visible (image-based)

FIR = official, structured, legally compliant First Information Report

You may keep both or merge them, but since YOU want FIR → we include it.

🧑‍💻 Developer A — Core + Assignment + Station-Level Entities

These entities form the base structure and handle officer deployment and hierarchy.

Developer A Tasks:
1️⃣ Station Entity

Essential base entity.

Fields:

stationId

stationName

location

contactNumber

2️⃣ User Entity

Represents Officer, Incharge, Commissioner.

Fields:

userId

name

email

rank

role

stationId (FK)

3️⃣ Shift Entity

Dependent on Station + User.

Fields:

shiftId

date

startTime

endTime

shiftType

stationId (FK)

userId (FK)

4️⃣ FIR Entity (Core Responsibility)

⚠️ FIR is important and connects deeply with Station + User → so Dev A should handle it.

Important FIR Fields:

firId (PK)

stationId (FK)

filedByUserId (FK)

complainantName

complainantPhone

crimeType

crimeDescription

crimeLocation

crimeDateTime

firDateTime

accusedName

accusedKnown (boolean)

sectionsApplied

severityLevel

status

investigationOfficerId (FK)

updatedDateTime

🧑‍💻 Developer B — Workflow Entities (Requests, Logs, Complaints)

These entities are dependent on the core entities and describe all officer activities.

Developer B Tasks:
5️⃣ LeaveRequest Entity

leaveId

userId (FK)

startDate

endDate

reason

status

6️⃣ SwapRequest Entity

swapId

requestingUserId (FK)

targetUserId (FK)

shiftId (FK)

reason

status

7️⃣ History Entity

historyId

userId (FK)

shiftId (FK)

action

dateTime

8️⃣ Complaint Entity (If kept separate)

complaintId

stationId (FK)

filedByUserId (FK)

complainantName

crimeType

crimeDescription

fileUrl (image upload)

status

⭐ Why This Task Split Is Perfect
✔ Developer A

Handles structural + high-dependency entities:
Stations, Users, Shifts, and FIR.
These must exist before workflow layers can be added.

✔ Developer B

Handles workflow + request entities:
Leave, Swap, History, Complaint — all dependent on User/Shift.

This avoids conflict, allows parallel work, and matches real backend team structures.

🗂 FINAL TASK SUMMARY (EASY TABLE FORMAT)
Entity	Developer	Reason
Station	A	Base entity
User	A	Required for all workflow entities
Shift	A	Depends on station + assigned user
FIR	A	High dependency, core police workflow
LeaveRequest	B	Workflow logic
SwapRequest	B	Workflow logic
History	B	Logging dependent on core entities
Complaint	B	Works after station + user

✔ Generate a Day-wise plan including FIR implementation
✔ Generate Service + Repository task distribution
✔ Generate Controller distribution
✔ Generate Kanban task board for the team
✔ Generate database schema SQL based on all entities

Just tell me:
“Generate next plan”,
or specify:
“Divide controller tasks”,
“Divide service tasks”, etc.

Here is your fully detailed 7-day development plan for Phase 1, including FIR implementation, entity creation, service logic, controllers, and task division for 2 developers.

This plan ensures parallel work, zero dependency conflicts, and a production-style workflow.

🚀 7-Day Backend Development Plan (Phase 1 — No JWT)
👥 Team:

Developer A → Core System, Database, FIR, Structural Logic

Developer B → Workflow Entities, Requests, Logs, Complaint

📅 DAY 1 — Project Setup + DB Setup + Planning
Developer A

Create Spring Boot project

Add dependencies: Web, JPA, MySQL, Lombok

Configure application.properties

Create MySQL DB: police_duty_matrix

Verify DB connection

Developer B

Set up Postman workspace

Create shared API Collection

Define JSON templates for: Station, User, Shift, FIR

Prepare ERD reference + naming conventions

✔ Output:

Project running

DB connected

API collection ready

Team alignment on structure

📅 DAY 2 — Create Core Entities (Station, User, Shift)
Developer A

Implement Station entity

Implement User entity

Implement Shift entity

Apply these relations:

User → Station (ManyToOne)

Shift → Station (ManyToOne)

Shift → User (ManyToOne)

Developer B

Create repositories for Station, User, Shift

Validate DB tables creation

Write sample POST bodies for testing

✔ Output:

3 core entities created

DB schema verified

📅 DAY 3 — Create Workflow Entities (Leave, Swap, History, Complaint)
Developer A

Begin FIR entity (structure only, no relations yet)

Finalize FIR important fields:

complainant details

crime details

officer details

FIR timestamp

IPC sections

severity & status

Developer B

Create:

LeaveRequest entity

SwapRequest entity

History entity

Complaint entity

Add all foreign keys:

userId

shiftId

stationId

✔ Output:

All 8 entities exist

DB tables created successfully

📅 DAY 4 — Core CRUD Services + FIR Service Setup
Developer A

Implement CRUD services:

StationService

UserService

ShiftService

FIRService (basic)

file FIR

view FIR by ID

view FIR by station

Developer B

Implement:

LeaveRequestService

SwapRequestService

HistoryService

ComplaintService

Add basic functionalities:

Create leave

Create swap request

Add history row

Upload complaint (text only first)

✔ Output:

Full CRUD service layer built

FIR basic filing implemented

📅 DAY 5 — Business Logic Implementation (Shift, Leave, Swap, FIR Extended)

assign investigation officer

update FIR status

filter FIR by severity

Developer B — Leave & Swap Flows
